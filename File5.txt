Dance and music as ancient performing arts have always been a part of the life of Indian people. Our religious literature recognised dance as an important activity in the human search for god. The relics of earliest civilisation in India clearly demonstrate the importance of dance.
In the later period too dance remained at the forefront of all the performing arts. We learn about it from the sculptures, from the paintings, as also from numerous textual treatises on the art of dance. Music too has an old and long tradition. It has also enjoyed patronage of the people in general.
In fact the birth of music lay, in the ancient past, in the religious activities of the people - the chanting of scriptures and paying musical offerings to gods is a well documented activity. It was also discovered then that the sound produced from different parts of the human body the abdomen, lungs, throat and head -made a system by itself.
The ratios and proportions which sound patterns displayed soon developed into an order called sruti. Gradually the musical scales were standardised and laws were framed to regulate the practice of singing and instrument playing.
This allowed the evolution of melodies and a system of musical notations (raag) to come into being. In its simplest and most obvious form and meaning, a dance is the physical expression of the emotive content of music.
The pleasure of music is in the listening; the pleasure of dancing is in watching that music take a bodily shape and express its meaning in a visual experience. In the Indian literary tradition there is no dearth of critical writings on the art of dance.
Both, at the level of theory and technique, the texts provide valuable information. But the most important and also fundamental among all these works is Natyashastra. It was composed by Bharat, a sage, and its date is generally believed to fall between the 2nd century B.C. and 2nd century A.D (in all probability around the 1st century A.D.).
India is a vast country. From Kashmir to Kanya Kumari and Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh, crores of people of different races and religions live in different parts of the country. They speak different languages, have different customs and put on different dresses, yet they are one. They are all Indians. They are one nation.
India is famous for its rich tradition of dance and music. In both dance and music there are two types called folk and classical. Different classical dances were born in different parts of India. Bharat Natyam comes from Tamil Nadu.Ka/ha/ca// comes from Kerala, Kathak from Northern India, Kuchipudi from Andhra Pradesh, Manipuri from Manipur and Odissi from Orissa.
Folk dances are much simpler. They are performed by villagers after their day's work is done. Folk dances are mostly based around the seasons. Some of the well-known folk dances are Bhangra from Punjab, Garba from Gujarat, Chhau from Bihar, Ghumar from Rajasthan and Bamboo from Nagaland.

Folk music is popular all over India. People sing folk songs on the occasion of a marriage. Folk singers move from village to village and sing ballads. A ballad is a story of brave heroes.

We have our own different types of musical instruments like flufe, shehnai, sitar, sarongi and the veena. There are some instruments like the tabla, mridangam, pakhawaj a'nd the ghatam which are beaten with the hand or with sticks.
Indian film music is the most popular form of music in our country. Most of our films, whether they are made in Hindi, Tamil or Telugu have many songs. Indian art and sculpture, like dance and music, are mostly based on religion. The earliest art to be found in India is Buddhist art. It is based on the teachings of the Buddha. An example of Buddhist art is the cave paintings at Ajanta, in Maharashtra. You will read more about them in the lesson on Places of Interest.
Miniature art, as seen in Pahari, Rajput and Mughal paintings, is very beautiful. in the old days, beautiful temples and other buildings were built with support craftsmen received from kings. From Emperor Ashoka, who helped build the stupas of Sanchi, to Shahjahan, who built the Taj Mahal. In this way architecture received great encouragement
